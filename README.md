## Game Background

You are an alien visiting the Earth. Your goal is to find 10 DNA samples.

But on the way to do that, humans may witness your flying saucer. They may tweet about what they see and the public pressure will terminate your agreement with some governments that secretly allow you to collect these DNA samples. So, you need to make the most influential tweets to be 404 as long as collecting DNA samples.

### Controls
